      #ReFresh is a super-active, trophy pushing clan that is striding to get to the top of EU leaderboards. We ranked 6th at the end of this season and we plan on improving that each season, and we will do it, with your help. We made a new clan, called #GetFresh (#QUPOC88) as our feeder on March 15th, 2017 and another one named #StayFresh (#29V2V8CR). Both of these clans will feed #ReFresh and they will help #ReFresh to get to the top of EU leaderboards and at the same #ReFresh will send down players to them so they can also grow!

      We are an extremely active and hard-working clan, both in game and outside. We usually have around 12-16 members online on our peak days and on our bad days, we have around 3-6 members online. Our  record was 21 members online at the same time. We host a few tournaments every now and then and we  have exclusive access to all the #Fresh tourneys! We also host fun, interesting clan events every week. We have recently started an Instgram account and we are also active on our Line group chat. For more info about joining, check contact us.

      Trophies is another major goal and reuirement of ours. We strive to reach the best trophies at reset and our feeders help us a great deal. Last season, we broke 47.5k and ended in 6th position. After reset, we usually end up at 3rd position but we now want to maintain that throughout the season. We usully improve our trophies by 1k each season and with your help, we might be able to improve that rate!
